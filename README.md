  ## Installation
  Users download the repo and run from Visual Studio Code, or their preferred editor. Required packages include Express.js and Mongoose. 
  
  The data from my repo is currently hosted by MongoDB Atlas, but users can create their own local environment if they prefer.
  
  To emulate without a front-end for the application, use Insomnia or Postman to test routes for Users and Thoughts. 
  
  Currently the database is set up to add users, create and delete friends, create, edit and delete thoughts, create and delete reactions to thoughts. If a user is deleted, their associated thoughts are also removed from the database.

  ## Usage
  Run in Insomnia after creating required routes, as listed in /routes folder.

  ## Credits
  Thanks to @kyler-Mclachlan for sharing your sharp eyes when one of my routes was not working! ðŸ¦…
